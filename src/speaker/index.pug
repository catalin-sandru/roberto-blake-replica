      h3 Thought Leadership and Influence
      p Consumers are shifting away from engaging with traditional advertising. This shift has seen a rise in brands leveraging the influence of popular online personalities that can reach their audience. Individuals who have become noted "Thought Leaders" and subject matter experts are valuable to brands who want to tap into their ability to influence consumers. My experience in this arena is both as a Thought Leader who has grown a large community, but also as a subject matter expert who has worked with high profile brands and advocated for them through sponsorship and affiliate marketing opportunities. 
      p My speaking sessions can guide content creators and expets on the path to building their credibility, growing a community and working with brands for mutual benefit.
